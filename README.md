# 📌 Prompt Engineering 

## 📖 Overview
This repository contains three practical exercises focused on Prompt Engineering techniques using modern language models. These exercises aim to demonstrate how prompt design impacts the quality, accuracy, and creativity of model responses.

🧠 Features  
- Basic to advanced prompt design  
- Zero-shot and few-shot prompting  
- Chain-of-Thought reasoning  
- Role-based prompts  
- Instruction tuning  
- Comparative analysis and optimization  

📁 File Structure
